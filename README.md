# Raspberry Pi Wireless Sensor Node

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a Raspberry Pi-based wireless sensor node for environmental data collection and remote communication.  It was created as part of a university research project. The sensor node is programmed in Java.

## Features

* **Raspberry Pi-based:** Utilizes the Raspberry Pi platform for data processing and connectivity.
* **Environmental Data Collection:** Designed to interface with sensors to gather environmental information.
* **Remote Communication:** Enables data transmission to a remote server or system. (Wifi)
* **Java Programming:** The core software is implemented in Java.
* **Modular Design:** Designed with a modular architecture for easy expansion and customization.
  
## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi
* Sensors
* Communication Module
* Power Supply
* Other components (e.g., breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, etc.)

## Software

* Java
* Raspberry Pi OS

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Hardware Setup:**
    * Assemble the sensor node according to the hardware schematic.
    * Connect the sensors and communication module to the Raspberry Pi.
    * Power on the Raspberry Pi.

2.  **Software Setup:**
    * Install Raspberry Pi OS on the Raspberry Pi.
    * Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on the Raspberry Pi.
    * Clone this repository to the Raspberry Pi:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/azeemabrarkhan/Wireless-Sensor-Node.git](https://github.com/azeemabrarkhan/Wireless-Sensor-Node.git)
        ```
    * Install any necessary Java libraries or dependencies (e.g., using Maven or Gradle).
    * Configure the communication module (e.g., Wi-Fi settings, cellular APN).

3.  **Running the Application:**
    * Compile the Java code
    * Run the main Java application on the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

The sensor node will automatically collect data from the connected sensors and transmit it to the specified remote location.
